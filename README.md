It's just a website project where a cyber <strong><font color="teal">newbie</strong></font> can write down all his step-by-step <strong><font color="teal">reasoning</strong></font> on platform challenges like <strong><font color="teal">TryHackMe, RootMe or CryptoHack</strong></font>. 
It's purely educational, and <strong><font color="teal">sharing is the key to progress</strong></font>.  
<strong><font color="teal">Good luck to you</strong></font>, I hope it helps you as much as it helps me!
